# SinCos-calculations
Compute sin/cos of arbitrary angle starting with small one

## What is here

Code sample (in F#) to compute sin/cos of some arbitrary value starting from small angle and using trigonometry formulas for angle doubling, angle halving and sum/difference of angles. Exhaust integer part of desired angle first, then do binay search. Somewhat close to the [CORDIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC).

## Prof of concept only

Should be a lot more for production code.
